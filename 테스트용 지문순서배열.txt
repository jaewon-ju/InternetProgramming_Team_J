(1) We are looking for college students who can help with the experiments during the event.
(2) I am contacting you to ask you to recommend some students from the chemistry department at your college who you think are qualified for this job.
(3) The goal of the fair is to encourage them to be interested in science through guided experiments.
(4) Dear Professor Sanchez,
(5) With their help, I'm sure the participants will have a great experience.
(6) Sincerely, Ellis Wight
(7) I look forward to hearing from you soon.
(8) We are holding a Chemistry Fair for local middle school students on Saturday, October 28.
(9) My name is Ellis Wight, and I'm the director of the Alexandria Science Museum.


(1) So we took a risk.
(2) I looked at Gregg.
(3) If I fell, he would fall with me.
(4) It wasn't a piece of cake.
(5) Our rope was tied between us.
(6) "Look, the first bolt is right there.
(7) The rock was deceptively barren of handholds.
(8) The bolt that would save my life, if I could get to it, was about two feet above my reach.
(9) I clumsily moved back and forth across the cliff face and ended up with nowhere to go...but down.
(10) Piece of cake," I persuaded Gregg, minutes before I found myself pinned.
(11) I can definitely climb out to it.
(12) My arms trembled from exhaustion.
(13) Gregg and I had been rock climbing since sunrise and had had no problems.
(14) My body froze with fright from my neck down to my toes.
